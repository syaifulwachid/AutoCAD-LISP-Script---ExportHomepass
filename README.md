# AutoCAD-LISP-Script---ExportHomepass
This LISP script is designed to work within AutoCAD to automate the process of exporting geographic location information from text objects and converting UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates to Latitude/Longitude (Lat/Lon). The output of the process is saved as a KML file, which can be opened in mapping applications such as Google Earth.
